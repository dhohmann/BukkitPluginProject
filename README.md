# BukkitPluginProject
This repository contains multiple plugins for Minecraft Bukkit Servers.

## Server owner
You can use all projects for your Bukkit servers with version 1.9.2 and higher. If you want to deploy the plugin to your server, you have to build the JARs by yourself. The project folders only contain the source files.

We recommend to use only the projects inside the master branch. These are tested and should work without problems.
